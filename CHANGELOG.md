# Changelog

All notable changes to the plugin and template are recorded here. The plugin version in
`plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` moves together.

## Unreleased

- Template evals gain `evals/run.sh` (shared by local and CI runs, with per-case `setup`), and the workflow installs the venv and the plugin whose hooks the suite exercises. Proven on the sandbox with five cases drawn from real incidents.
- Template gains the Maintain stage: `ops/detect.py` (deterministic detection, tested), `ops/loop.sh` (tiered response), `.github/workflows/closing-the-loop.yml` (unattended schedule). Proven end to end on the sandbox: tier 2 diagnosis and a tier 3 intent PR.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-09-02

Found by the first end-to-end brownfield test.

- Merged `plugin/commands/` into the skills. A command and a skill sharing the name `adopt` collided in the unified namespace; the command won and the skill body never loaded. `intent`, `spec`, `plan`, `adopt` and `babysit-pr` are now user-invocable skills with argument hints.
- Renamed `intent-format`, `spec-format`, `plan-format` to `intent`, `spec`, `plan`.
- `adopt` documents its scope argument and how each scope maps to its steps.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-02

Initial skeleton derived from Anthropic's "The AI-Native SDLC playbook" (August 2026).

- `docs/`: the methodology for humans, one file per play.
- `plugin/`: skills, agents, commands and generic hooks installed into every project.
- `plugin/template/`: per-repo files copied into a new or existing project.
- `brownfield/`: the adoption runbook for existing repositories.
- `org/`: managed settings and marketplace hosting, owned outside any repo.
- `scripts/new-project.sh`: greenfield bootstrap.
