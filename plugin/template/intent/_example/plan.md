# Plan: claims status self-service (from intent.md 2026-06-02)

Accepted by: engineer 2026-06-05. Record: CLM-482.

## Files that change

portal/src/claims/StatusPanel.tsx (new), claims-api/routes/status.py,
claims-api/tests/test_status.py

## Order of work

1. Add the status endpoint behind existing auth.
2. Panel against the endpoint.
3. Wire into the portal nav.

## Risks

The claims-core API rate-limits at 50 rps; the panel must cache.

## Proof

test_status.py covers the four claim states; screenshot matches the
approved mock.
